When you would you to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

* When I want to make it public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

* The remote repository might have a partial commit that might now work completely by it's own. 
And if your local repository keeps changing automatically, that might cause you some confusion when 
you are working on your own local changes.
